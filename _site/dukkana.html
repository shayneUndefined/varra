      Quack, quack.<br> - Dukkanese proverb
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>These small beings may look adorable and can seem quite wholesome,  but it is important to always remember that many have short tempers and are just as often fierce fighters than not.</p>

    <br>
    <h3>Early Life</h3> <p>A dukkan hatches from a large, often speckled egg and spends the first few weeks of its life attempting to waddle and continually falling over in a comical yet adorable manner.  Its parents will do their best to raise their offspring, often in a large gaggle of children. The small fowl family will wander about the land, from body of water to body of water,  leaving a trail of half eaten fish corpses in their wake. They keep watchful eyes on their children, and as they typically become quite paranoid and protective of their children,  they begin training their young for combat at quite an early age. By the time a dukkan reaches sexual maturity, it has already acquired a number of survival skills.</p> <p>At some point, dukkana feel a natural urge to explore the world and become their own person. It is at this point that they leave their (likely large) family and usually never return.</p>

    <h3>Beliefs</h3> <p>Dukkans are non-communal family-oriented beings; for this reason, there are few organized or structured religious and spiritual beliefs among the dukkan people. Instead, they rather elevate their  familial ancestors to a deified status. One will often hear a dukkan tell talltales of their incredibly courageous grandparents or their incredibly powerful ancient ancestors. </p>

    <h3>Origins</h3> <p>A dukkan hatches from a large, often speckled egg and spends the first few weeks of its life attempting to waddle and continually falling over in a comical yet adorable manner.

It is at this point that they leave their (likely large) family and usually never return.</p>

    <p>
      <p>While almost all dukkana alive today speak the Common tongue,  Dukkanese is still taught as their first language within most dukkana  families. Dukkanese is at once both immensely simple and incredibly complex. It contains simply one sound: "quack." It is the way the "quack" is spoken (tone, speed, pitch, timbre, etc) along with a myriad of other visual and aural cues (tongue clicks, facial expressions, handwaving, so on and so on) that determines the meaning. It is in this way that the dukkanese language is able  to express a myriad of complex concepts with simply one basic sound.</p>

    </p>
    <p>It is very easy to tell if a dukkan comes from a proud family lineage or if they are one of the more rare independent wanderers, for in traditional dukkan culture it is the family name which comes first. Presenting one's own personal name first is a massive taboo within traditional dukkan culture, but has become increasingly common in recent years as the very nature of dukkan social customs means there is no real consequence to doing so, as it is rare for unrelated dukkans to run into each other.</p> <p>It is also incredibly difficult </p>
