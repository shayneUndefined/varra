  Quack, quack.<br> - Dukkanese proverb
</div>


  <br>
  These small beings may look adorable and can seem quite wholesome,  but it is important to always remember that many have short tempers and are just as often fierce fighters than not.

  IDK man like quack


  <p>
    
    While almost all dukkana alive today speak the Common tongue,  Dukkanese is still taught as their first language within most dukkana  families. Dukkanese is at once both immensely simple and incredibly complex. It contains simply one sound: "quack." It is the way the "quack" is spoken (tone, speed, pitch, timbre, etc) along with a myriad of other visual and aural cues (tongue clicks, facial expressions, handwaving, so on and so on) that determines the meaning. It is in this way that the dukkanese language is able  to express a myriad of complex concepts with simply one basic sound.
