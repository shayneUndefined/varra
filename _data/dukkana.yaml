  While almost all dukkana alive today speak the Common tongue, 
  Dukkanese is still taught as their first language within most dukkana 
  families. Dukkanese is at once both immensely simple and incredibly complex.
  It contains simply one sound: "quack." It is the way the "quack" is spoken (tone, speed,
  pitch, timbre, etc) along with a myriad of other visual and aural cues (tongue clicks, facial expressions, handwaving,
  so on and so on) that determines the meaning. It is in this way that the dukkanese language is able 
  to express a myriad of complex concepts with simply one basic sound.
